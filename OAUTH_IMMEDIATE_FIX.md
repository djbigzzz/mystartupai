# Immediate OAuth Fix - Alternative Approach

## The Issue
Your OAuth consent screen appears to not be fully configured, which is causing the 404 error. Let me provide multiple solutions.

## Solution 1: Complete OAuth Consent Screen Setup

### Navigate to OAuth Consent Screen:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent
2. OR: In Google Cloud Console, go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "OAuth consent screen"
3. If you see "Configure consent screen", click it

### Required Settings:
- **User Type**: External
- **App name**: MyStartup.ai
- **User support email**: Your email
- **Authorized domains**: Add `mystartup.ai`
- **Application homepage**: `https://mystartup.ai`
- **Developer contact**: Your email

## Solution 2: Use Alternative Redirect URI

I'll add support for a simpler callback URL that might work immediately.

## Solution 3: Verify Domain Ownership

The 404 could be due to domain verification. You may need to verify `mystartup.ai` domain ownership in Google Search Console first.

## Next Steps:
1. Try accessing: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent directly
2. Complete the consent screen configuration
3. If that doesn't work, I'll implement alternative callback strategies
