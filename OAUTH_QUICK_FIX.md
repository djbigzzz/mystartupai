# OAuth 404 Error - Quick Fix

## Issue Identified
You're testing OAuth on mystartup.ai but the callback URL isn't in Google Cloud Console yet.

## Current URLs in Google Console
From your screenshot, you have development URLs but NOT the production mystartup.ai URL.

## Required Action
Add this exact URL to Google Cloud Console OAuth Client:
```
https://mystartup.ai/api/auth/google/manual/callback
```

## Temporary Workaround
For immediate testing, use the development domain until mystartup.ai callback is added:
```
https://dcce2b51-81d9-4f52-b724-4633b7613eaa-00-1pco1isub73pc.spock.replit.dev
```

## Status
- OAuth works on development domain ✅
- Need to add mystartup.ai callback URL to Google Console ⚠️
- Then OAuth will work on both domains ✅
