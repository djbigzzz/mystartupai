# OAuth Status - Debugging Current Issues

## Problem Analysis
- mystartup.ai callback URL added to Google Cloud Console ✅
- OAuth initiation working on both domains ✅
- Callback returning "oauth_failed" on both domains ❌

## Possible Causes
1. **Google propagation delay** - New callback URLs can take 5-60 minutes to propagate
2. **Environment detection issue** - Production vs development domain confusion
3. **Session configuration** - Session handling between domains

## Current Test Results
Both domains are correctly generating OAuth URLs but callbacks are failing.

## Immediate Solutions
1. Wait 15-30 minutes for Google propagation
2. Test on development domain first (known working callback)
3. Add fallback error handling

## Production Impact
mystartup.ai is live but OAuth needs propagation time or configuration adjustment.
