Encrypt Everything
Everything is public on Solana. But not everything should be. Arcium is the encrypted supercomputer, bringing encrypted compute to any application or use case at Solana speed and scale. Arcium opens a completely new design space for onchain apps, where privacy can be integrated in the most versatile and performant way. We're excited to see what you build with Arcium for the Cypherpunk hackathon and <encrypted> Side Track!

Mission
Integrate Arcium's encrypted compute into a new or existing Solana project. 

Hackathon Track Scope

We're looking for innovative applications that leverage Arcium's capabilities. Here are some product ideas that could be particularly interesting:

Dark Pools / Private Trading: Create a trading venue where orders remain hidden until execution, preventing front-running and MEV.

Permissionless, Fair Prediction & Opinion Markets: Develop markets where information remains private, ensuring fair play and preventing manipulation.

Private Perpetuals: Implement perpetual contracts with encrypted parameters to enhance privacy for traders.

Private Lending & Borrowing: Build lending and borrowing protocols where sensitive user data or transaction details are kept confidential.

Hidden-Information Games: Create games like Dark Forest, Blackjack, Poker, or even concepts from games like Fortnite, CS:GO, Diablo, or Zelda, where certain information needs to be hidden from players or observers to ensure fair gameplay. This could include hidden states, player positions, or other game-critical data.

Apps with MPC-generated randomness: Cards, slots, and other use cases need randomness to ensure fairness.

We just launched Phase 2 of our Testnet with the biggest suite of encrypted apps on Solana. Join the growing ecosystem now! Explore here: https://www.arcium.com/testnet

Resources
Arcium is the encrypted supercomputer, enabling encrypted compute at the speed of light, bringing privacy to every use case that needs it â€” with zero trust. Now, public blockchains like Solana can access encrypted computing, enabling programs to define specific functions to be executed in a fully encrypted way. This redefines blockchain capability, providing a new fabric for onchain applications to process sensitive data while opening the door for privacy-sensitive institutions and offchain use cases.
