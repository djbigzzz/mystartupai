About DAWN
DAWN are building a new user-owned, Decentralized Broadband network. By leveraging rooftop antennas and a peer-to-peer marketplace built on Solana, DAWN empowers individuals to become self-sovereign internet providers. At the center of this movement is the Black Box, a powerful DePIN-ready router designed to host everything from peer-to-peer broadband to AI and privacy applications. We believe it’s inevitable that every household will one day include a toaster, an oven, and a Black Box. At this Cypherpunk hackathon, what new use case will you launch on the Black Box?

The DAWN protocol and hardware together give users the tools and trustless infrastructure needed to deliver their own internet connectivity, backed by onchain transparency and security.

About the Track
The track is to build a new decentralized application (dApp) for DAWN’s Black Box. The Black Box supports virtual machines, Docker containers, and Linux containers (preferred).

Our partners and the Black Box specs are listed here. For example, the Black Box can provide compute for Arcium, supporting privacy enhancing technology. The Black Box can provide compute for inference.net, making user-owned AI a reality.

Hackathon Track Scope

Here are some product ideas that could be particularly interesting:

Privacy: build something cypherpunk.

AI: Have a personal AI agent trained and fine tuned to you, but cypherpunk.

Gaming: provide compute for in game cypherpunk AI agents.

Home entertainment: Build an app to turn the Black Box into a home entertainment device, but cypherpunk.
