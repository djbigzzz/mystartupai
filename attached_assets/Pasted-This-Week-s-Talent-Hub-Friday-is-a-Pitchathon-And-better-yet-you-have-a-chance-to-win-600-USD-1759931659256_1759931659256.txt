This Week's Talent Hub Friday is a Pitchathon!

And better yet - you have a chance to win $600 USDC! 💰

The prizes are just the icing on the cake, the real value is in the learning and experience you’ll get from the day. This is your chance to sharpen your public speaking, presentation, and pitching skills, with live feedback, mentoring, and resources to guide you.

Before we begin the Pitchathon, we have a special guest short-session with Paul Dylan-Ennis (@polarpaul) Lecturer/Assistant Professor in the College of Business, University College Dublin. His research focuses on the cultural and social aspects of the wider Web3 ecosystem, makes him the perfect canditate to explain the ethos of Cypherpunk, the core theme of this year's Colosseum Hackathon. (https://colosseum.com/)

After that, we’ll kick things off with a short introduction on how Pitch Time fits into the Colosseum: Cypherpunk Hackathon: this is where you can test your project idea, get feedback from judges, and refine your pitch before submitting to the global competition.

After that, we’ll go through the judging criteria, so you know exactly what to focus on:

🔒Problem - How clearly have you defined the challenge or pain point? Is it real, specific, and relevant to the world today?
🔑Solution - How strong is your idea? Does it solve the problem in a creative or technically sound way?
🌐Solana Fit - How well does your project leverage Solana’s speed, scalability, or ecosystem? Are you using the tech in a meaningful way?
💭Feasibility - Is this something that can realistically be built? Have you thought about team roles, timelines, or early traction?
🗣Presentation - Is the pitch clear, confident, and engaging? Do you communicate your idea in a way that gets others excited?

Each team will have 3 minutes to pitch, followed by live judging and scoring based on the above areas.

If you already have a project ready for Colosseum, use this as the perfect rehearsal.

If you don’t have a project yet - no stress. Use the next few days to brainstorm or team up with others, and if you’re still forming ideas on the day, arrive a bit early - we’ll help you craft a pitch so you can still get the full benefit of the session.
