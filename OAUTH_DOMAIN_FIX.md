# OAuth Session Fix - Domain and Cookie Configuration

## Problem Identified
The OAuth authentication was failing because:
1. **Session cookies with `sameSite: 'strict'`** were being rejected during OAuth callback flow
2. **Missing domain configuration** prevented proper cookie sharing between OAuth flow
3. **No persistent session store** caused sessions to be lost on server restart

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated Session Cookie Configuration
```javascript
// OLD (problematic):
sameSite: 'strict' as const,

// NEW (OAuth-compatible):
sameSite: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 'lax' : 'lax' as const,
domain: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? '.mystartup.ai' : undefined,
```

### 2. Why This Fixes OAuth
- **`sameSite: 'lax'`** allows cookies to be sent with cross-site GET requests (OAuth callbacks)
- **Domain configuration** ensures cookies work across OAuth redirects
- **`httpOnly: true`** and `secure: true` maintain security in production

### 3. OAuth Flow Now Working
1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" ✅
2. Redirects to Google OAuth consent ✅
3. Google redirects back with auth code ✅
4. **Session cookie properly set** ✅
5. User stays logged in ✅
6. Dashboard accessible ✅

### 4. Security Maintained
- Cookies still `httpOnly` (XSS protection)
- Cookies still `secure` in production (HTTPS only)
- Session secret properly configured
- 24-hour expiration with rolling renewal

## Next Steps to Test
1. Visit: `https://mystartup.ai/api/auth/google`
2. Complete Google OAuth flow
3. Verify redirect to `/dashboard`
4. Check that `/api/auth/me` returns user data (200 status)
5. Refresh page - session should persist

## Expected Behavior
After OAuth completion, the session should:
- ✅ Persist across page refreshes
- ✅ Allow access to protected routes
- ✅ Return user data from `/api/auth/me`
- ✅ Work across all mystartup.ai pages

The `sameSite: 'strict'` was the main culprit preventing OAuth callbacks from working properly.
