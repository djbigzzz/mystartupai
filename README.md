## The Problem

Nine out of ten startups fail because founders build products nobody wants.

**The AI Coding Paradox:** Tools like Replit Agent, Lovable, Bolt.new, and v0.dev can now build a full app in under an hour. But validation still takes weeks and costs thousands. So instead of wasting months building one wrong idea, founders now waste days building ten wrong ideas.

Building got faster. Validation didn't. That's the gap we're filling.

## Our Solution

**Your AI co-founder who won't let you build the wrong thing.**

Meet Vale, The Validator. Before you write a single line of code, Vale runs real-time market research using Perplexity AI to analyze competitors, market size, customer pain points, and funding landscape. You get a comprehensive validation report with a clear verdict: GO, REFINE, or PIVOT.

No expensive consultants. No waiting weeks for research reports. Just honest feedback in minutes, powered by live web data and Y Combinator-inspired methodology.

**The workflow:**
1. Tell Vale your idea (3-minute form)
2. Vale conducts live market research across the web
3. Get scored across 10 dimensions with actionable recommendations
4. Refine and re-validate until your score is strong
5. Then‚Äîand only then‚Äîbuild it with Replit Agent or Lovable

Think of us as the sanity check before you start building. We're not here to tell you your idea is great. We're here to tell you the truth.
