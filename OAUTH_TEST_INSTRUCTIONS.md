# OAuth Testing Instructions - Session Fix Applied

## ✅ Changes Made
1. **Fixed session cookie configuration**: Changed `sameSite` from 'strict' to 'lax'
2. **Added domain configuration** for production cookies
3. **Maintained security**: Still using `httpOnly` and `secure` flags

## 🧪 How to Test OAuth Now

### Step 1: Clear Browser Data (Important!)
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab → Storage
3. Click "Clear storage" or manually delete cookies for `mystartup.ai`
4. This ensures clean testing environment

### Step 2: Test OAuth Flow
1. **Visit**: `https://mystartup.ai/api/auth/google`
2. **Complete Google sign-in process**
3. **You should be redirected to**: `/dashboard`

### Step 3: Verify Session Persistence
After OAuth completion, test these:

1. **Check authentication status**:
   ```
   Visit: https://mystartup.ai/api/auth/me
   Expected: User data (200 status) instead of 401 Unauthorized
   ```

2. **Test page refresh**:
   - Refresh the dashboard page
   - You should stay logged in

3. **Test direct navigation**:
   - Navigate to: `https://mystartup.ai/dashboard`
   - Should load without redirect to login

## 🔍 What Was Wrong Before

**The Problem**: `sameSite: 'strict'` cookie setting
- Prevented cookies from being sent during OAuth callback
- Google redirects count as "cross-site" requests
- Browser rejected session cookies during OAuth flow

**The Fix**: `sameSite: 'lax'` cookie setting
- Allows cookies during OAuth redirects (safe GET requests)
- Maintains security for form submissions
- Industry standard for OAuth implementations

## ✅ Expected Results After Fix

1. **OAuth initiation** → ✅ Redirects to Google
2. **Google consent** → ✅ User authorizes app  
3. **OAuth callback** → ✅ Session cookie properly set
4. **Dashboard redirect** → ✅ User sees dashboard
5. **Session persistence** → ✅ User stays logged in
6. **API access** → ✅ `/api/auth/me` returns user data

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

If OAuth still fails, check:
1. Browser console for cookie errors
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Clear all browser data and try again
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

The session cookie fix should resolve the authentication persistence issue you were experiencing.
