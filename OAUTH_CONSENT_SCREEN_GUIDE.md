# OAuth Consent Screen Configuration - Step by Step

## Current Issue
You're getting a 404 error from Google OAuth, even though the redirect URI is correctly configured. This is typically caused by OAuth Consent Screen misconfiguration.

## Go to OAuth Consent Screen Settings

**IMPORTANT**: You're currently in the OAuth Overview. You need to navigate to the OAuth Consent Screen settings.

### Steps:
1. In your current Google Cloud Console window
2. Look at the left sidebar menu
3. **Click on "OAuth consent screen"** (not "Overview")
4. This should be under "OAuth Auth Platform" section in the left menu

### What to Check in OAuth Consent Screen:

#### 1. App Information
- **App name**: Should be "MyStartup.ai" or similar
- **User support email**: Your email address
- **App logo**: Optional but recommended

#### 2. App Domain (CRITICAL)
- **Application homepage**: `https://mystartup.ai`
- **Application privacy policy link**: `https://mystartup.ai/privacy` (if exists)
- **Application terms of service link**: `https://mystartup.ai/terms` (if exists)
- **Authorized domains**: Add `mystartup.ai` to this list

#### 3. Developer Contact Information
- Your email address

#### 4. Publishing Status (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Should show **"In production"** or **"Published"**
- If it shows **"Testing"**, this could be causing the 404 error

## Common 404 Causes:
1. **App in Testing Mode**: Only test users can access
2. **Missing Authorized Domain**: `mystartup.ai` not in authorized domains
3. **Incomplete Consent Screen**: Required fields not filled

Please navigate to the **OAuth consent screen** section and share a screenshot of those settings.
