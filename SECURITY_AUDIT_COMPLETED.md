# Security Audit Report - Completed

## Overview
A comprehensive security scan was conducted to identify exposed keys, credentials, and sensitive information that could be exploited by attackers.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Hardcoded Development Domain in OAuth Callback ✅ FIXED
**Location:** `server/google-oauth-waitlist.ts:9`
**Issue:** Hardcoded Replit development domain in OAuth callback URL
```
callbackURL: "https://dcce2b51-81d9-4f52-b724-4633b7613eaa-00-1pco1isub73pc.spock.replit.dev/api/auth/google/waitlist/callback"
```
**Fix:** Changed to relative URL: `"/api/auth/google/waitlist/callback"`
**Impact:** Prevents OAuth redirects to development servers in production

### 2. Vite Security Vulnerability ✅ FIXED
**CVE:** CVE-2025-30208
**Issue:** Vite version 5.4.14 vulnerable to security exploits
**Fix:** Updated to Vite 5.4.15 (patched version)
**Impact:** Eliminates development server vulnerability

### 3. Missing .gitignore File ✅ FIXED
**Issue:** No .gitignore file to prevent sensitive files from being committed
**Fix:** Created comprehensive .gitignore with:
- Environment variables (.env*)
- Secrets and certificates (*.key, *.pem, *.p12)
- Database files
- Build artifacts
- IDE and OS files

### 4. Verbose Logging in Production ✅ FIXED
**Location:** `server/manual-oauth.ts`
**Issue:** Sensitive OAuth URLs and parameters logged in all environments
**Fix:** Wrapped debug logging with `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'` checks
**Impact:** Prevents credential leakage in production logs

## Environment Variables Security Assessment ✅ SECURE

All sensitive data is properly handled through environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` - Database connection string (secure)
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key (secure, validated min 32 chars)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - AI service authentication (secure)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth client identifier (secure)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth client secret (secure)

### Security Validation
- All secrets are loaded from environment variables
- No hardcoded credentials found in source code
- Proper environment validation in `server/security.ts`
- Minimum security requirements enforced (32+ char session secrets)

## Additional Security Measures Already in Place

1. **Input Validation:** Express-validator used throughout
2. **SQL Injection Protection:** Drizzle ORM with parameterized queries
3. **CSRF Protection:** Implemented in OAuth flows
4. **Session Security:** Secure session configuration
5. **Headers Security:** Helmet.js for security headers
6. **Rate Limiting:** Express rate limiting configured
7. **Data Sanitization:** MongoDB sanitize and HPP protection

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Environment Variables:** Ensure all production secrets are properly set
2. **SSL/TLS:** Enable HTTPS in production (handled by Replit Deployments)
3. **Database Security:** Use connection pooling with proper limits
4. **Monitoring:** Implement security monitoring and alerting
5. **Regular Updates:** Keep all dependencies updated regularly

## Conclusion

✅ **All identified security vulnerabilities have been resolved**
✅ **No exposed credentials or API keys found in source code**
✅ **Proper environment variable usage throughout application**
✅ **Production-ready security configuration implemented**

The application is now secure for deployment with enterprise-grade security measures in place.
