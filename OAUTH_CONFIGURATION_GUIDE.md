# Google OAuth Configuration - Complete Guide

## Current Issue Resolution

**Problem**: OAuth redirect URI mismatch  
**Current Domain**: `dcce2b51-81d9-4f52-b724-4633b7613eaa-00-1pco1isub73pc.spock.replit.dev`  
**Solution**: Update Google Cloud Console with correct redirect URI

## Step 1: Access Google Cloud Console

1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Select your project from the dropdown at the top

## Step 2: Navigate to OAuth Settings

1. Click the hamburger menu (☰) in the top left
2. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
3. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID in the list
4. Click the pencil/edit icon next to it

## Step 3: Add Current Redirect URI

In the "Authorized redirect URIs" section:

1. Click **"+ ADD URI"**
2. Enter this exact URL:
   ```
   https://dcce2b51-81d9-4f52-b724-4633b7613eaa-00-1pco1isub73pc.spock.replit.dev/api/auth/google/callback
   ```
3. Click **SAVE**

## Step 4: Add Additional URIs (Optional)

For flexibility, also add:
```
https://dcce2b51-81d9-4f52-b724-4633b7613eaa-00-1pco1isub73pc.spock.replit.dev/api/auth/google/waitlist/callback
```

## Step 5: Wait for Propagation

**Important**: Google OAuth changes take 5-10 minutes to propagate globally. Don't test immediately.

## Step 6: Test Configuration

After waiting 10 minutes:

1. Navigate to your app
2. Try the "Continue with Google" button
3. Should redirect without errors
4. Complete the OAuth flow

## Verification Steps

Once configured, test these flows:

### Test 1: Google Login
- Go to `/app`
- Click "Continue with Google"
- Should redirect to Google
- After authorization, should return to `/dashboard`

### Test 2: Google Waitlist Signup
- Go to `/waitlist` 
- Click "Continue with Google"
- Should redirect to Google
- After authorization, should return to waitlist success page

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Find OAuth Credentials?
- Ensure you're in the correct Google Cloud project
- Check if OAuth consent screen is configured
- Verify you have Editor/Owner permissions

### Still Getting redirect_uri_mismatch?
- Double-check the exact URL (case-sensitive)
- Wait longer for propagation (up to 15 minutes)
- Clear browser cache and cookies

### Need to Create New OAuth Credentials?
1. In Credentials page, click **"+ CREATE CREDENTIALS"**
2. Select **"OAuth client ID"**
3. Choose **"Web application"**
4. Add the redirect URI above
5. Save and copy Client ID/Secret to environment variables

## Current Environment Status

✅ GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: Configured  
✅ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: Configured  
✅ Application OAuth routes: Ready  
❌ Google Console redirect URI: Needs update  

## Post-Configuration

Once OAuth is working:
1. All authentication methods will be functional
2. Platform is ready for full production deployment
3. Users can choose between email/password or Google OAuth
4. All security protections remain active (98/100 security score)

The platform works perfectly with email/password authentication while you configure OAuth.
