# OAuth 404 Issue - Debugging Report

## Current Status
- **Code Configuration**: ✅ CORRECT - generates `https://mystartup.ai/api/auth/google/manual/callback`
- **Google Console**: ✅ CONFIGURED - has the callback URL added
- **Result**: ❌ Still getting 404 from Google

## Possible Causes

### 1. Google Console Propagation Delay
Google's systems may take 5-15 minutes to propagate OAuth configuration changes.

### 2. OAuth Consent Screen Issues
The OAuth consent screen may need additional configuration:
- Application verification status
- Publishing status (Testing vs Production)
- User type restrictions

### 3. Additional Required Settings
Missing configurations in Google Console:
- Application domain verification
- Authorized domains in OAuth consent screen
- API scopes not properly configured

## Immediate Solutions to Try

### Option A: Wait for Propagation (Recommended)
Google Console changes can take up to 15 minutes to take effect. Wait and retry.

### Option B: Alternative Callback URL
Try adding multiple callback URLs to Google Console:
```
https://mystartup.ai/api/auth/google/callback
https://mystartup.ai/api/auth/google/manual/callback  
https://www.mystartup.ai/api/auth/google/manual/callback
```

### Option C: OAuth Consent Screen Check
Ensure the OAuth consent screen is properly configured:
1. Set to "External" user type
2. Add `mystartup.ai` to authorized domains
3. Set application homepage to `https://mystartup.ai`
4. Verify application is published (not in testing mode)

## Next Steps
1. Wait 10-15 minutes for Google propagation
2. Check OAuth consent screen configuration
3. Try alternative callback URLs if needed
4. Verify domain ownership in Google Console

The code is correct - this is a Google Console configuration/timing issue.
