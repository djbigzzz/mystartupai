# OAuth 403 Error - Consent Screen Fix

## Progress Made ✅
The 404 error is FIXED! OAuth requests are now reaching Google successfully.

## Current Issue: 403 Error
Google is returning "403. That's an error. We're sorry, but you do not have access to this page."

## Root Cause
This is a Google OAuth consent screen configuration issue. The OAuth app needs to be properly configured for external users.

## Fix Required in Google Cloud Console

### 1. OAuth Consent Screen Configuration
Go to: **Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**

**Check these settings:**
- **User Type**: Must be set to "External" (not Internal)
- **Publishing Status**: Must be "In production" or "Testing" with test users added
- **Scopes**: Ensure `profile` and `email` scopes are configured

### 2. App Status
Your app might be in "Testing" mode which limits access to specific test users.

**Options:**
- **Option A**: Publish the app (submit for verification)
- **Option B**: Add test users in the OAuth consent screen settings

### 3. Domain Verification
Verify that `mystartup.ai` is added as an authorized domain in:
- **OAuth consent screen** → Authorized domains
- **Credentials** → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs → Authorized redirect URIs

## Quick Test
Add your email as a test user in the OAuth consent screen to test immediately.

## The OAuth Integration is Working
The code is correct - this is purely a Google Console configuration issue.
